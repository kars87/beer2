# beer2
# Planning to create beer fermenter with esp32. Will try to add web server version, mqtt version, and mySQL version later.

will transelate text english later 

as for now its missing:
- deadband heating
- inputs for setpoints
- logic for hours/days to adjust setpoint
- PWM for heating. This program is for controlling fridge. So no pwm on cooling, only deadband later.
